# ChatSkell
An IRC bot written in Haskell, based off of the project guide found on the [haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Roll_your_own_IRC_bot#). I have edited the bot for more personal use cases and to be used on a InspIRCd instance I run on my home lab :)

I also though maybe I should create my own IRC server but that seems like a project for another date (and for a languauge i am more comfortable in!)
